# profdr

A theme for [Prof. Dr.](http://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style/). Even though you are academic, you are probably not Prof. Dr. Because of that, please use the generic [academic page](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) theme instead.

profdr was forked from [true minimal theme](https://github.com/cyevgeniy/jekyll-true-minimal/), which is copyrighted [cyevgeniy](https://github.com/cyevgeniy/) and released under the GPL-2.0 License. See LICENSE.
